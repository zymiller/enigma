    "For this project I decided to recreate the Enigma encryption machine used by the Axis powers in WW2. For this I created specific classes for the different mechanisms in the machine and have a large method in my last Machine class that does all the encoding and decoding. I would reccommend watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybkkiGtJmkM) to get a basic understanding of how all the components on the real machine worked and interacted with eachother. \n",

    "The cell below will create 5 real rotors used in the Engima M-3 machine. The machine only used 3 but 5 were always available to create a bigger diversity of possible messages. The rotor codes were taken from the [cryptomuseum](https://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/enigma/m3/index.htm) (Wheel wiring near the bottom of the page). I only used I - V because the other rotors were used for the Kriegsmarine which is a whole different rabbit hole with different machines and rotor designs and whatnot.\n",

It's only when the rotor moves to the next letter (i.e. the letter 1 ahead of the letter on the website) does the next rotor finally move."

So if you had an HZ connection, that would mean that before and after every scrambling through the machine, every H would be replaced with a Z and vice versa. In the war the standard number of plugs used in the plugboard was 10 plugs (20 letters).

    "Although I think I got the basic idea of the machine down, this is nowhere near a perfect replica. Some later machines used 4 rotors and even a rotating reflector which I was not able to make. Also, the Enigma I machines (what I tried to make here) had a quirk called a double step where when the second rotor moved, on the rare occasion that it lined up so that the third rotor could move, it (the second rotor) would actually move twice when it's only supposed to move once in tandem the third rotor. It's incredibly rare and hard to visualize so I decided to not try to code this in as I didn't feel that it was possible since I don't have an enigma machine to reference, nor have I ever seen one in person either."
